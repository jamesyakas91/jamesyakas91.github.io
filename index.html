        <p>Although aesthetics is not my forte, I am more concerned with functionality. I do try my best to create
            visually pleasing designs, but my primary focus is on building functional and efficient software solutions.

        <p>While aesthetics may not be my forte, I place a strong emphasis on functionality in my work. I strive to
            ensure that every application I develop is user-friendly and meets its intended purpose effectively. Despite
            my focus on functionality, I do my best to create visually appealing interfaces.</p>
